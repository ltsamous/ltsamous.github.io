summary: I contributed alongside a great team of developers to create a website which would serve as a resource to those looking for aid during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic.

During the Fall of 2020, I was given a unique opportunity to work alongside Information and Computer Sciences classmates at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to create a meteor web application. This application would go on to serve residents of Hawaii by helping them find useful information regarding the COVID19 pandemic. 

In order to help those seeking important COVID information, each team member compiled a list of resources which included links to websites, phone numbers, emails, and all other useful information. It was then organized into a web application. My specific role on this particular project was to create the student resources section. I did this by using a cart style layout provided by the semantic-ui react homepage. 


Here is a screenshot of some sample code taken from my student resources homepage:


The page layout turned out to look like this:


The other main contribution I had on the COVID KOKUA project was the login portion. I made it possible to login as a user in which the user would then be able to add resources and make changes.

The project was managed using github desktop, in which each team member made their own branch, then cloned to their local desktop. When their branch was error free and fully functional, it would then be merged with the main branch. The bulk of the work was done using intellij, which github would save changes to, allowing  each member to push their changes to their branch. Finally the web application was deployed to digital ocean and is fully operational. 

This project has been a very valuable learning experience and I hope it helps people in need of COVID resources. Also a big thanks to my teammates who helped make this project and professor Dr. Johnson and his star TA Brandon Ogata for providing meaningful direction and feedback.
