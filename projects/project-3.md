summary: A Driving game I developed for my ICS 111 class
---

This was my first game developed in my programing journey. The game consists of a single car driving through an obstacle course. The objective of the game is to collect all of the animals on the screen by running them over. When the animal is run over, the game collects the animal and starts a count, upon collecting all animals without hitting any of the obstacles such as trees, houses, and even a volcano, the game ends and the player wins. I used java to program this game and it took lots of tries and practice runs to get everything to run properly. The game uses pictures, audio, and text based images to provide a cool, fun asthetic, (at the begginner level) look. It may not be the most high level game but for my first game, it was quite fun to program!
