summary: A fun poker game developed in my ics 111 class
---

During the first semester of my Junior year, I helped contribute to a fun poker game for my ICS 111 class. This was a great learning experience for me because I was a new programer at the time. Before that class I had never coded before and I was a little bit nervous taking on a complicated project. My team mates helped me a lot with the project and understanding how it all worked. Granted my team mates did most of the hard work and implementation, however it was very beneficial to me to see how it was done. We created the game in java, which upon running would launch a graphical user interface (GUI) which had the games blackjack and seven card stud. We also implimented a settings tab which could control the audio card style. The whole project took a couple weeks and was overall a very fun and valueable experience.
