I teamed up with a forecaster named Alex Gibbs who works the wave models for the National Weather Services Honolulu. Every day I checked the surf heights for all sides (North, South, East, and West) for the islands, Maui, Big Island, Oahu, and Kauai. I found these wave heights using local webcams, bouy data, social media postings, and any other form of surf report. i then logged in all of the wave heights onto a google docand collected the data for three months. The purpose of this project was to compare the data with the new surf forecast product issued by National Weather Services Honolulu daily and note any noticible descrepancies. This project is still in the works and is almost finished. All that is left is to plot some graphs in python and see how the data looks on-screen, then do a formal analysis on our finding.

The project has been a great learning experience so far, I look forward to seeing how this conclude.
