## INTRODUCTION

  Upon being introduced to semantic ui, someone that comes to mind is my significant other. She enjoys creating, customizing, and designing an assortment of things. Despite her lack of interests in the field of Computer Science, she is quite meticulous and would excel with no doubt if she took the time to learn semantic ui. One thing I enjoy about online user interface building is that the results of proficiency can be seen instantaneously. 
	
## MY TIPS

  Website constructing is difficult so being able to see it complete encourages me as I feel accomplished. A few suggestions I would share with other novice creators such as myself is that, spending time familiarizing yourself with the material goes a long way. Building websites takes time and research. Additionally, I found the semantic ui website extremely helpful as there were examples of code implementation that allowed us to simply copy and paste.Another way of making our lives much easier when using semantic ui is to memorize the main things we have to use such as menu layouts, fonts, colors, ect. It’s good to have a wide variety of tools memorized in our arsenal so that if we have to constantly be working on our websites, we can do it very fast and efficiently. Similar to many things in life, learning a new toolset takes time and can be frustrating, however once we master it, it becomes very beneficial in the long run, and that’s really what this is all about. We can either just use html and css and do it the long and hard way making subpar UIs, or we can take some time to master a tool that will help us build beautiful websites! 
	
## TAKEAWAYS

  Something important to keep in mind is that all of us use many different websites and we rely on them being clear and easy to use to take care of business. If anyone can remember a time they had to use a website that was very unuser friendly and unattractive, they must know and understand the frustration and disappointment of the experience, such are common with many DMV, unemployment, and basically any government websites that we need to use. Let us not make websites like those, and instead make websites that look good, make people feel good, and maximize their online experience!
