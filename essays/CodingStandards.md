title: "Flexibility"

Often times when we are told that we need to do something that is new and out of our ussual routine, it ruffles our feathers. We are creatures of habit and thrive on a solid rythm. I personally thrive on a good consistant rythm, and it bothers me when I have to change it. The reason I prefer a solid rythm is that it is the most efficent way of getting things done. Upon introduction to the concept of coding standards, it seemed like just another extra step that is out of my usual routine. However the concept of coding standard goes hand in hand with my work philospohy. Since we all love consistancy and thrive on it, shouldn't we expect the same with our code? If all of our code was consistant and conformed to a certain standard, it would make all of our lives much easier. Even though it may seem insignificant. Going forward, it will be in mine, my peer's, and my superior's best interest that I thoroughly acquaint myself with tools such as ESLint, checkstyle, and all other coding tools to conform my code to a specific standard.
