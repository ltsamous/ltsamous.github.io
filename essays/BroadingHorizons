## Unexpected Interest

I have heard from many people who have gone to college and graduated that often times when we go to college, our interests and goals change. I don't believe that is true for me. I am a senior undergrad and my goal of forecasting weather and surf still have not changed. However I cannot say that I havent opened my mind to pursuing other types of careers as well. 

  Ever since I took ICS 111 at UH Manoa and was introduced to programing, I have taken a serious interest to coding. Am I the best at it? No way. However it is really interesting to me and I get the satisfaction when my code finally runs and passes all the tests. I also have found a liking to solving unique and interesting problems. In particular, in my software engineering class, we have what is called Workout of the Days, or WODS. I definatly have a lot of practice to do when it comes to solving these, and I know I will get better with time. Doing things like WODs, and understanding tough problems so far has been really fun despite the challenges and I am anticipating lots of future work and rewards if I continue this path.
