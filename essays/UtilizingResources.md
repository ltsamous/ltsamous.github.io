## Finally Learning how to Learn

It took me at least 2 years of my undergrad to finally realize what I need to do to learn hard material. The difficult classes kept getting harder, and the curriculum was becoming ever more impossible to do alone. I believe that is the story of many college students who are in hard majors and aren't naturally good at school. It can be intmidating especially when it seems like everybody around you understands the material. Aquiring more efficient study habits has saved me hours of unproductive toiling. And once we figure out what works for us, it is a game changer.

## No Fear
  
  The biggest hurdle for me in my academic career was reaching out to my proffessors, I felt intimidated asking questions and going to office hours because I felt like I would be judged for not knowing anything. Somebody then reminded me how much we are paying for tuition, and I realized that as students, we are entitled to getting help from our proffesors, it is what they are getting paid to do! I also stopped caring what my proffesors may think because most of the time they are happy to help!
  
## Work Smarter Not Harder
  
  Even as little as 20 minutes of good prodcutive learning is so much better than hours of confusion and frustration. If I spent more than an hour trying to work out a problem with no progress, it is definatly time to get help or switch up how I'm doing it. After all, doing the same thing every time and expecting a different result eventually is the definition of insanity.
